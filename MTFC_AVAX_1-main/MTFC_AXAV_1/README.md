# Todo List Smart Contract

This Solidity program is a simple Todo List application that demonstrates the use of smart contracts to manage tasks on the Ethereum blockchain. It serves as an introductory project for those who want to learn how to build decentralized applications using Solidity.

## Description

This program is a smart contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows users to create, update, and delete tasks in a todo list. Each task is stored on-chain, ensuring transparency and immutability. This project serves as a practical example of how smart contracts can be used to manage state and data in a decentralized manner.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file with a `.sol` extension (e.g., `Todo.sol`) and paste your Solidity code into the file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Ensure the compiler version is compatible with your Solidity code, and then compile the contract.

After compilation, deploy the contract by navigating to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab. Once deployed, you can interact with the contract functions to manage your todo list on-chain.
