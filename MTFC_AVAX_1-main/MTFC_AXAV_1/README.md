Todo Contract README
Overview
This repository contains a Solidity smart contract named Todo. The Todo contract allows users to manage a list of todos, with functionality to create, update, mark as completed, retrieve, and delete todos. The contract is designed to be owned by a single address, ensuring that only the owner can perform certain actions.

Installation
No installation is required for this contract. It is intended to be deployed to a blockchain network such as Ethereum.

Usage
To use this contract, you'll need to deploy it to a blockchain network. After deployment, you can interact with it through a web3-enabled front-end application or a tool like Remix IDE.

Deploying the Contract
Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler compatible with the specified pragma version (0.8.22).
Deploy the compiled contract to a blockchain network of your choice (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby).
Interacting with the Contract
After deployment, you can interact with the contract using its ABI (Application Binary Interface). Here are some common interactions:

Creating a Todo: Call the createTodo function with the title and description of the todo.
Updating a Todo: Call the updateTodo function with the index of the todo to update, along with the new title and description.
Marking a Todo as Completed: Call the markTodo function with the index of the todo to mark as completed.
Retrieving a Todo: Call the getTodo function with the index of the todo to retrieve.
Deleting a Todo: Call the deleteTodo function with the index of the todo to delete.
Getting All Todos: Call the getAllTodo function to retrieve all todos.
Checking Consistency: Call the checkConsistency function to verify the integrity of the todo list.
Functions
Constructor
Initializes the contract owner to the address deploying the contract.
onlyOwner
A modifier that reverts transactions if the caller is not the owner of the contract.
createTodo
Allows the owner to create a new todo with a given title and description.
updateTodo
Allows the owner to update an existing todo by index with a new title and description.
markTodo
Allows the owner to mark a todo as completed or incomplete by toggling its isCompleted status.
getTodo
Retrieves the details of a todo by index.
deleteTodo
Deletes a todo by index.
getAllTodo
Returns all todos in the list.
checkConsistency
Performs an internal consistency check to ensure that all todos have a valid isCompleted status.
