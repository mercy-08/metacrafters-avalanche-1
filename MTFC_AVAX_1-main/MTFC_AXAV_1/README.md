# Todo List Smart Contract

A decentralized application to manage a todo list on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.

## Description

This Solidity smart contract allows users to create, update, and delete tasks in a todo list. Each task is stored on-chain, ensuring transparency and immutability. It demonstrates how to manage data in a decentralized manner using Ethereum. This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to Solidity and decentralized applications (dApps).

## Getting Started

### Installing

* Download the program by cloning the repository or copying the Solidity code.
* No additional modifications are required.

### Executing program

1. Open [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Create a new `.sol` file (e.g., `Todo.sol`).
3. Paste the contract code into the file.

```bash
# Compile the contract
Use the "Solidity Compiler" tab to compile.
# Deploy the contract
Navigate to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab and deploy the contract.
```

## Help

For common issues or compiler errors, ensure the Solidity version in Remix matches the version used in the contract.
